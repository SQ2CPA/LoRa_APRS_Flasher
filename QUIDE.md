# How to flash your device correctly?

1. Select your device type (Digi/IGate supported for now)
2. Select your board
3. Select your firmware version (if you want other than latest)
4. Flash type is only available as First flash / Factory reset. If you want to update your software please do that via OTA
5. Click "Flash firmware"
6. Select your port (check twice if is correct)
7. You can wipe your device first but that's not required
8. Don't close, move web flasher page and your device during flashing

You can't "brick" your device. If flashing failed just check your port try again
